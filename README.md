> NOTE: This repository is IN-PROGRESS.

This is a passion project led by Isaac Chacko to implement a ranked math of sorts. Players can go head-to-head in quick math duels that test their knowledge across many math disciplines. The goal right now is to make a working prototype where users can sign in, enter matchmaking, fight a quick duel, and watch their rise on the public leaderboard.
