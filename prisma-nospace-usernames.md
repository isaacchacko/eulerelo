# goal

- [ ] refocus prisma development database from prod to something spun up locally
- [ ] make usernames have no spaces or special characters so its easy to have a profile/<name> url

# envisioned commits

- [x] make todo doc (this)
- [ ] create `seed.ts` file so that other developers can also spin up a local server. change the env file and send it over so that the database points locally
- [ ] make better username checking, making sure that no spaces/special characters are allowed. (whatever restrictions we apply they have to be all focused on making the profile url work)
